### üöÄ About Me

I specialize in delivering **full-stack** and **AI-driven** solutions, handling everything from initial discovery to backend APIs, frontends, deployment, and monitoring. My focus is on measurable results, robust architecture, and an excellent developer experience.

- üá≥üá¨ Based in Nigeria ‚Ä¢ open to remote/contract
- üß† LLM/RAG systems, agentic workflows, classical CV/NLP
- üß© Full-stack delivery: **FastAPI** backends, **React/Next.js** frontends, **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**, **Docker**, **CI/CD**, **Nginx**, **Azure/AWS**

---

### üß≠ What I Build

- **Full-Stack Apps:** Authenticated dashboards, CRUD + search, reporting, multi-tenant admin tools, payments, file processing, and robust RBAC.
- **AI Systems:** Retrieval-augmented assistants, function-calling agents, evaluation/telemetry loops, computer-vision pipelines, domain-specific NLP.

### üìà Impact at a Glance

- Built an **LLM-based product specialist assistant** (OpenAI + Azure AI Search) that **cut response times by 60%** and **boosted agent efficiency by 40%**.
- Delivered a **FastAPI** backend enabling content generation and client Q&A, leading to a **70% decrease in response times**.
- Integrated **Tavily** and domain search to serve **95% accurate** responses.
- Designed **agentic workflows** with function calling to **improve query resolution times by 55%**.
- Created a **body-controlled rehab game** (React + Phaser + MediaPipe) that raised patient adherence by **60%**.
- Built a **diet suggestion engine** (FastAPI) achieving **95% matching accuracy**.
- Automated **drone-based tree counting** (YOLOv8), saving **80+ research hours per project**.
- Shipped a **swine management chatbot** (Next.js + LLM + MongoDB + FastAPI) that cut resource waste by **20%** and improved yield by **15%**.
- Deployed **satellite power-grid detection** (OpenCV + YOLOv8) at **93% accuracy**.
- Built an **LLM/NLP knowledge tool** that saved diplomats **~4 hours/week**.
- Launched a **case-study matcher** (MongoDB + embeddings) lifting lead conversion by **15%**.
- Implemented a **multimodal misinformation detector**, cutting manual review time by **70%**.
